	<h2>Chrysalid</h2>
	
		<p>There is another Earth. Like Schrodinger’s Cat, our Earth exists in two plausible states and there’s no one around to prove which is actually real.</p>

		<p>Just after the time of creation, the other Earth (henceforth referred to as Chrysalid) experienced an alteration of some seriously fundamental laws. Water, the hallmark of our blue planet, ceased to exist on the surface. Instead, every single molecule of water rose up and stayed suspended several feet above the ground and extended up, up into the stratosphere.</p>

		<h5>Chrysalid: The Ocean</h5>

		<p>The suspended sea does not carve canyons into the earth’s surface or fill deep basins or run through forests. Rather it is a spherical homogenous aquarium with fixed depth. Life flourishes, but with a narrow array of creatures.</p>

		<p>Despite reaching high altitudes, the suspended sea does not freeze over. There are strenuous currents that keep the water temperature relatively stable throughout the depths.</p>

		<p>There are photosynthesizing plants which crowd the surface with gigantic, floating leaves and flowers. Pollination occurs from above and below by wind, currents, and living creatures.  One plant, however, has done something remarkable.</p>

		<p>The rhizomongous plant has long, flexible limbs which are laughably pliant to the touch. On their own, they flail, sink, and die.  But amid the cacophony of other plant life, they grow vine-like and slowly wrap around the others and eventually form a tangled web. This design is incredibly strong, supporting long tendrils of roots that dangle down in the sea.</p>

		<p>The roots continue to grow, and as the center is hollow, do not have much mass. When the roots penetrate the sea floor, there are profound consequences for life on Chrysalid.</p>

		<h5>Chrysalid: The Surface</h5>

		<p>The planet surface is cool, but not as cold as you might think. The sun does not penetrate the deep seas, but periodic volcanic events spew superheated gases into the narrow band of air, like a steamy exhalation.  There are some mountain ranges which stick up into the suspended sea due to the action of tectonic plates, but otherwise the surface is utterly smooth. And sandy.</p>

		<p>The suspended sea, like our earth’s sea, generates a constant stream of detritus. There are dead plants and animals, excretions, et cetera.  These particles fall to the ocean floor and stay suspended in a sort of reverse adhesion process. </p>

		<p>Life on the surface of Chrysalid must get most of its energy from the ocean floor (a few feet above the surface).  Dominating the sandy surface are 7-foot-tall grazing creatures with vacuous mouths which hang agape and troll the ocean floor for sustenance through curtains of baleen.  Their lower bodies are snakelike, rapidly careening across the sandy surface.  They digest the nutrients and excrete the waste as sand (think parrotfish on our earth). This is why the entire earth is covered with sand.</p>

		<p>The surface of Chrysalid is dark. Actually, darker than that. Black.  There are no plants. The animals have no sight as it would serve no purpose. Animals have varying degrees of hearing, smell, and echolocation.</p>

		<p>Trapped underneath the suspended seas, the air below could become a toxic soup of gases expelled from the earth’s core.  But the air is naturally cleansed thanks to the hollow root tendrils of the rhizomongous.</p>

		<h5>Chrysalid: Sentient Life</h5>

		<p>Most life on the planet’s surface is constantly moving, eating, and reproducing. That is, there is no stopping, ever, until death. Without sunlight, there’s no external rhythm of night/day or seasonal change.  Animals lack biorhythms or circadian clocks.  But there is one exception.</p>

		<p>One animal, the ablator, has evolved in close connection with the rhizomongous. The biology of the two species is intricately linked.  The most intriguing aspect of this coevolution is the audio component.</p>

		<p>The sounds at the ocean’s surface are readily delivered through the hollow root system of the plant- to the air below the sea.  Due to the vascular structure of the plant, sound only conducts from top to bottom.  The ablators have always been tuned in to the frequency of life way, way above them.  There are various cracks, cackles, rips, and whoops. There’s a constant whisper of wind and random chit-chattering-goo-goos.  But there’s also the click-clack of a language.</p>

		<p>Listening twice daily are these heavyset, pilose creatures who gather in troops around the dangling roots.  Ablators could be described as obese and truly ugly to us. But of course they are never seen as all animals down here are blind and live in obscurity.  Their fur is white, devoid of pigment.  These creatures have huddled this way for generations and are intimately familiar with the sounds from above.  The click-clack language is what maintains their interest, as they “know” the language. That is, they know every single word and are used to the frequency of its use. They recognize individual voices and the idiosyncrasies of each speaker.</p>

		<p>The devoted listeners are social creatures and enjoy commenting on the daily audio stream. But despite all this, ablators do not know what a single “word” of the click-clack language means. They have never experienced the completely different environment above the suspended sea and therefore have no way to begin to piece together what the sounds refer to. They have an addiction to a meaningless language of sounds.</p>

		<p>When the listening time is over, they spend their remaining time hunting, grooming, and socializing.  They are a charismatic bunch whilst together, and it is key to their hunting strategy.</p>

		<h5>Ablator: The Hunt</h5>

		<p>Bottom line, these are slovenly carnivores surrounded by lightning-quick serpentine prey.  They must rely on their intelligence or they wouldn’t stand a chance. Over several hours, they patiently arrange themselves in a tight, circular ring.  It is time-intensive since their bodies move reluctantly, despite having 3 sets of legs (in order to support the excess girth). During this preparation, the snakey prey easily avoids the lumbering shapes, detecting the shuffling sounds and movements.</p>

		<p>At long last, when the formation is perfect, they begin to dig. Well, dig may not be the right term, as they have perfected a wiggly maneuver that allows them to permeate the sandy surface with ease, not at all like arduous digging.  Their blobby bodies elasticize and spread out in a pancake shape.  After just a few minutes, the circle of ablators has transformed into a circular mountain of sand.  There can be hundreds of individuals involved, in order to create a very gradual incline which rises several feet in the air at the top.  In the center is a very deep hole.</p>

		<p>Like a spider’s web, once spun, it only requires patience. Sooner rather than later, the prey slithers up the sandy slope and drops into the hole.  The hunters designate two elders to then enter the hole and leisurely roll atop the now panicked animal.  Another two or three assist to pin down the meal, rendering the serpent immobile.</p>

		<p>As you may have guessed, there is a ritualized way the prey is eaten so that special parts, especially the baleen plates, are reserved for particular individuals.  So the prey is painstakingly ablated, each organ and tissue type having a place in the culinary hierarchy. Meanwhile, all this ritual incurs an indescribably slow and excruciating death for the hapless victim.</p>

		<h5>Ablator: Reproduction</h5>

		<p>Ablators do engage in sexual reproduction but each individual is equipped with both male and female equipment.  A combination of environmental and social factors will determine whether or not a given individual procreates as a male or a female.  Many eggs are fertilized with each pregnancy- generally 12, with occasional sets of 13 or more.</p>

		<p>The eggs spend little time in the womb, rather they are expelled after a mere two weeks, emerging as one unit, like an ice-cube tray. The tray is placed by the parent inside a pouch, which dangles loosely on the side of the body, a bit like a marsupial, but in a more slipshod fashion.  Some trays do not even make it to the pouch, as the ablators seem barely cognizant of the egg expulsions.</p>

		<p>If placed successfully, the tray slowly dissembles and tiny ablators grow and fraternize inside the furry pouch.</p>

		<p>Ablators do not fret over their progeny. In fact they practically ignore their young ones until they reach maturity, or at least can engage in conversation. The young ones stick together, and basically listen to the conversations of the adults.  Unlike our young children, these youths do not crave physical activity as they are preparing to be supremely sedentary adults.</p>

		<p>As a result of this sloppy parenting, many trays of eggs are simply dropped or spill out of the flimsy pouches.  Some even enter the ocean bottom, which generally leads to death in one way or another.</p> 

		<h5>Chrysalid: Sentient Life Above the Sea</h5>

		<p>Life has taken completely different forms above the sea.  Bathed in intense light, high winds, and high altitude, the animals here have adapted modes of flying, swimming, and anchoring. Nothing walks as there are no terrestrial surfaces.</p>

		<p>Surrounding the rhizomongous plants are colonies of spiky, many-armed creatures. They sort of resemble brittle stars, but they have 8 arms as well as 2 tentacles.  The arms constantly move about- above and below the sea.  Each arm has sensitive bristles as well as an eyeball which provides sensory input to its distributed brain. Rather than one brain at the center of the body, each arm has a mini-cortex which is connected to all the other “mini-brains” in each arm.</p>

		<p>These echinocons communicate by click-clacking their teeth which are located at the center of the body. The mouths are notably large and are filled with white shiny teeth.  When echinocons talk, the sound is quite robust, like when we clap our hands but even shriller.  Depending on which teeth are struck and the angle, the individuals create very distinct types of sounds.</p>

		<p>The auditory landscape above the sea is dominated by echinocons who can pass hours each day click-clacking to each other about territory, mates, and most of all, eyeballs.  In the same way that humans recognize faces, echinocons focus on eyeballs. Remember, each individual has one eyeball per arm so that is eight eyeballs. Each eyeball is connected to a mini-cortex. Each eyeball can therefore reflect a different version of the “soul”.  Eye color is also a way to differentiate – and discriminate – among individuals.</p>

		<p>Perhaps due to the harsh conditions in which they evolved, echinocons are ruthless predators and are not terribly kind to each other. They have an intensity about life which is effective yet cold.</p>

		<p>Echinocons release sperm and ova once a year into the ocean surface, in an annual spawning event much like corals on our earth.  Once larva are created, echinocons corral them into special cave-like orifices of the plants floating on the surface.  These nurseries are guarded vigilantly until the young ones can emerge as fully-functioning adults. The maturation process takes about six months.</p>

		<h5>Chrysalid: Something new happens</h5>

		<p>So these animals –the terrestrial ablators and the high-altitude echinocons- existed in this physically separate fashion for many eons. There were other animal life forms existing on the planet, in the ocean, and above the ocean, but none of these others are terribly relevant to our story. You might be intrigued to know that much of the marine life on Chrysalid resembles life forms that also evolved on our earth- a sort of convergent evolution.</p>

		<p>After many millennia of homeostasis, a unique chain of events occurred. One of the stray ablator egg trays that was lost to the sea was spotted by a shark-like fish. It approached quickly with an open mouth and snagged the tray with a violent jolt.  It managed to swallow whole all but one of the larva- but the remaining one floated away on a vigorous current of water.  It traveled for an hour or so undetected, until it finally got stuck on the top of a turtle shell!  Yes, there are turtles on Chrysalid too! This turtle had recently been injured and its shell had a mangled, distended portion which is where the larvae landed and stuck.</p>

		<p>The turtle didn’t even notice the larva at first and continued to roam around the sea.  This allowed the larva to traverse great distances unharmed.  Over the course of a few days, however, the larva grew and started to shift position a bit. This caused an intense itching sensation for the turtle who chose to scrape its shell near the surface on a hard plant casing.</p>

		<p>This is where our larva has the good fortune of dislodging from the shell and floating into an echinoderm nursery. The larva was still so small and diaphanous that the sentry didn’t even notice the alien penetration of the nursery.</p>

		<h5>Chrysalid: Babies</h5>

		<p>What an unlikely twist of fate! How this baby ablator ended up in the nursery of echinocons is a marvel of statistics!</p>

		<p>As it happens, the echinocon young were in the very early stage of their gestation. You could detect they were radial animals with multiple limbs, but they were only about the size of your fingernail at this stage.</p>

		<p>The baby ablator, on the other hand, was developing fast and needed more food. It quickly outgrew its sac of nutrients that was part of its birthing film.</p>

		<p>Oh the poor ablator! Normally the little guy would thrive on scraps of meat dropped sloppily from its mother into the pouch.  Up here in this foreign place it was forced to find another way to survive and so it necessarily began to feed on the baby echinocons which surrounded him.</p>

		<p>The young ablator instinctually ate the parts of the echinocons which were most delicious. That would not include most of the arms, unfortunately, since they were lined with thorny bristles which scraped the ablator’s mouth. It was the soft tentacles and tender eyeballs that were eaten with gusto by the rapidly growing ablator.</p>

		<p>It wasn’t long after this menu was established that the adult echinocons finally discovered the furry ball inside the nursery.  They didn’t understand what it was and didn’t even realize it was alive until the little ablator gave a loud burp!</p>

		<p>The echinocons were so astonished by this curious creature that it disarmed their normally militaristic ways. The fuzzy white living ball was endlessly intriguing and downright funny to the echinocons. Since ablators are naturally slothful, the baby ablator was a perfect, docile pet. The enraptured echinocons named him “≤°°≥” which phonetically sounds a bit like “click-AAAAA-AAAAA-clack”.</p>

		<p>≤°°≥ was allowed to live in the nursery since he was unable to tolerate the bright sunshine outside the darkened nursery. Groups of echinocons would visit the fuzzy delight throughout the day.  Inbetween visits, the fledgling ablator fed on their babies.</p>

		<h5>E-con: Renaissance</h5>

		<p>It may surprise you that weeks went by before the echinocons realized what ≤°°≥ was eating.  The nursery was littered (pun!) with babies and it would have been hard to detect a slight reduction in number.  In addition, the echinocons were taken so off-guard by this unique situation that they didn’t even consider what the little guy was eating.</p>

		<p>Beyond these basic facts, our little ≤°°≥ had triggered a revolution in echinocon culture. As previously stated, the echinocons had been living for eons with the same old conventions.  It was a utilitarian, un-fun existence. There was a lot of chatter, but mostly revolving around eyeballs which was the basis for social hierarchy.  With the arrival of our furry pet, echinocons discovered they could have a compassionate side and it started to influence their relationships. All kinds of new things started to happen as side effects- new words were invented to describe new feelings and attitudes, new activities occurred which were just “for fun” (some of which we would describe as art), and on and on. It was a renaissance and the population was well aware that this was the dawn of a new era.</p>

		<p>Back in the nursery, our ablator had been discarding the unwanted bristly arms behind him in a dark corner.  The pile wasn’t very noticeable until it reached above the head of the ablator and finally an echinocon went to see what this mountain could be.</p>

		<h5>Chrysalid: Language</h5>

		<p>Besides eating lots of eyeballs, ≤°°≥ was deprived of a normal ablator upbringing. Normally he would be surrounded by siblings in a pouch and develop social skills. So without realizing it, little ≤°°≥ was somewhat depressed.</p>

		<p>However, ≤°°≥ was learning the echinocon language. His mouth and vocal chords were not at all like the echinocons so he could not entirely replicate those sounds. However, both species had big teeth which was the crucial component in sound formation.</p>

		<p>Despite this ability to converse with his adoptive species, our poor ablator had no words to explain the grisly discovery in the dark corner.</p>

		<h5>Chrysalid:     </h5>

		<p>The echinocon community was abuzz with the terrible news. It was hard to reconcile that their wonderful pet had been eating their progeny! Everyone was so infatuated by this pet that had radically changed their community- what could be done?</p>

		<p>After emptying the nursery of all the infants, the echinocons started to deliver various foodstuffs to ≤°°≥ in an attempt to find a nutritious, palatable alternative food supply. They caught flying insects and millions of little copopods. They tried minnows and horseshoe crabs. But to no avail. Our little guy tried to eat these offerings but none of them were tolerated by his system. He would get sick and feel even more hungry and miserable.</p>

		<p>After over a week, the community came to the horrific conclusion that if they wanted to keep ≤°°≥ they would have to feed him one of their own…on a regular basis…for an indefinite number of years!</p>

		<p>The echinocons could not squelch the amazing creature that had brought them this new age of compassion, productivity, and joy. So they focused instead on how to choose the individuals for sacrifice.</p>

		<p>The echinocons turned to the eyeballs of course. The eyeballs had always been the source of gossip, social structure, and discrimination. In choosing victims the echinocons were able to unleash their grievances in a condoned environment. All the stereotypes and unspoken biases were unleashed onto the public sphere as fair game.</p>

		<p>This new atmosphere felt like a witch hunt and it wasn’t long before the echinoderm community fell from its rapturous heights into a new low of hatred and fear. In their longing to preserve the new renaissance, they fell unwittingly into the depths of horror.</p>

		<p>After a few weeks, a feeding schedule was established along with some rules for choosing the unlucky ones to be sacrificed. The normal chit-chattering and click-clacking conversations became stilted and cautious. There seemed to be no way out of this vicious social landscape.</p>

		<p>But a rumor started to circle which gained ground and became a very popular meme. Perhaps it was an effort to cope with the extreme cognitive dissonance of their situation? In any case, the growing consensus was that our little ≤°°≥ was more than a pet. He was Special All-Knowing Father Mother. In other words, he was God.</p>

		<p>This conceit was opportune for the community – it served to assuage any guilt they had about killing their own. In addition, the alternative activities (“art”) resumed again in order to convey their profound feelings toward the new deity. And most of all, it made being chosen as the next sacrifice a wonderful honor rather than a terrifying murder.</p>

		<p>Once again, the echinocons enjoyed a structured, rule-based social contract which was much like their original way of life. But the religion allowed for some new outlets such as art and there were pockets of compassion that sprang up now and then.</p>
